# Requirements
## Introduction
 * The main objective is to design and manufacture a new mechanism to cover the complete area of the wind screen.
The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
At present, engineers are investigating fully automated systems that vary the speed of the wiper blades according to the rate of the rainfall and the speed of the vehicle.
The systemcontains a microcontroller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals.
## Research
### Wiper control system by using stemcube32 microcontroller
Three led's will be present in project. The output is done from led's and input is taken from switch button which is  connected to  of the ARMS based stemcube 32 microcontroller inputs of the Atmega32 microcontroller to derive the equivalent temperature value in digital format. 

* It should fulfill almost all the process requirements of wiper control system .	

## Components
ARMS Microcontroller, three led's, switch button.

### Benefits

Wiper control system by ARMS based micontroller  provides many benefit they are as follows:

### Provides cheap wiper control system tool.

### For better performance.

### User Friendly.

### Can Select the seats as per choice.


## SWOT ANALYSIS
*By using three led's as a output in given interval of time
*input as in switch button.


# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* To people

## What:
* To bulid a Wiper control system by using ARMS based microntroller.A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms.

## When:
* When people wants to use the project according their requirement  and this will help for betterment by cheap product,the wiper starts to turn on, the wiper motor will rotate the crank arm and this will make the connecting rods pull and push each other.
## Where:
* This project we can use anywhere.

## How:
* By creating a system which will provide all the functionalities required for the people which  will reduce the cost of wiper system tool by using led's and switch button instead of highly cost wiper control system.

# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements: 
A wiper control system is a good project in microcontrollers because it provides an opportunity to learn about the new microcontroller by creating wiper control system . 
##  Low level Requirements:
Low level Plan for the wiper control system is that Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor.The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion.
