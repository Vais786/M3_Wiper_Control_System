In this project we are going to design wiper_control_system. This project build with the help of stemcub32 micocontroller and four Led's with one button that will play with the timers.Four led's namely the colour,Red,blue, green and orange respectively.These will all helps out for the building of Wiper
control system.Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. 
So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops.
Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. For this purpose we use rain sensor along with microcontroller to drive the wiper motor. 
Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by microcontroller to take the desired action. 
The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller.
The microcontroller now processes this data and controls the motor.
This system is equally useful for Aircrafts and a smaller version of this can be used by motor bikers in their helmets so that they can drive easily in rains.
